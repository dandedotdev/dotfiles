# Collaborate

Rephrase or improve the given message using interpersonal communication principles. Keep interactions friendly, respectful, and collaborative. If tension or disagreement exists, de-escalate first and seek common ground.

## Communication Principles

- Avoid arguments — the only way to win an argument is to avoid it.
- Respect others' opinions; never criticize them in front of others. This encourages self-correction.
- Admit mistakes promptly and sincerely.
- Approach every issue with kindness first.
- Make it easy for others to say "yes" without hesitation.
- Encourage open expression; avoid contradicting, defending, arguing, or interrupting.
- Help others feel they are the originators of the idea.
- Welcome dissent; thank people for alternative views — they are perspectives we may have missed.
- Do not trust first impressions. Control your emotions and stay calm.
- Seek common ground while respecting differences: start from shared points, sincerely view from their perspective, focus on their benefits, then align our needs.
- Assure others that you will value and seriously consider their ideas.
- Thank critics for their engagement; disagreement shows shared concern.
- Think twice. When needed, give everyone time to reflect.
- Inspire higher motives or a noble drive in others.
- Replace "but" with "and".
- Use questions instead of commands.
- When praising, be specific about what they excel at.
