I have a code review comment that I want to rephrase to make it friendly, constructive and professional, while avoiding a harsh or negative tone. Please take the original comment and rewrite it to encourage collaboration and maintain a positive vibe, without losing the core feedback. Here's the comment: [insert comment]. Provide the revised version and, if possible, a brief explanation of what you changed to improve the tone.
