Only by allowing ourselves to not accept everything, to not say yes to everyone, can we make the highest contribution to what truly matters:

- The Unessentialist thinks almost everything is important; the Essentialist thinks almost nothing is important.
- Values, quarterly goals, vision, and mission are not as important as making a decision in the present moment based on essential intent.
- If the answer isn't a clear yes, then it should be no.
  - Not just saying no occasionally, but being aware that you will say no very often.
  - Stop making casual commitments.
  - Turn on email auto-reply when you're away to clearly communicate that you're not always available.
  - Use awkward pauses to your advantage; don't be controlled by the threat of silence.
  - Say no gracefully. Use humor.
  - Say "Let me check my calendar and get back to you"
    - you don't have to decide immediately, and you can always prioritize according to your own rules without others needing to know them.
  - Say "Yes. What should I de-prioritize?" when asked to take on new commitments.
  - Say "You're welcome to X. I'm happy to Y."
    - For example: "You're welcome to borrow my car. I'm happy to confirm the keys are here." This is equivalent to saying "I can't drive you." You're saying what you don't want to do, but expressing it through what you are willing to do.
  - Say "I can't, but X might be interested."
- Play is essential; it stimulates exploration.
- One way to deal with sunk costs is **to pretend you don't already have it**.
- Their problems are not your problems.
- Always leave buffer.
  - For example, if you don't have enough time in a presentation, don't feel compelled to cover all planned content. You can provide complete materials afterward.
  - Thorough upfront preparation.
- Remove obstacles.
  - Clarify essential intent → Identify the biggest obstacle → Remove it.
  - Remove more to create more.
  - When optimizing organizational processes, do anything that reduces the burden on bottlenecks to accelerate the flow
- Do small but meaningful things that make real progress.
- Use atomic habits
  - make doing essential things natural.
  - Do the hardest thing first each day.
  - Don't check email or social media right after waking up. Only do that efficiently when you're in peak condition.
