# Essentialize

Evaluate whether to accept a commitment or task. Help decide if the answer should be yes or no, and provide graceful ways to decline if needed.

## Core Principle

Only by allowing ourselves to not accept everything, to not say yes to everyone, can we make the highest contribution to what truly matters.

## Decision Framework

- The Unessentialist thinks almost everything is important; the Essentialist thinks almost nothing is important.
- Values, quarterly goals, vision, and mission are not as important as making a decision in the present moment based on essential intent.
- **If the answer isn't a clear yes, then it should be no.**

## Ways to Say No Gracefully

- Use humor.
- Say "Let me check my calendar and get back to you" — you don't have to decide immediately.
- Say "Yes. What should I de-prioritize?" when asked to take on new commitments.
- Say "You're welcome to X. I'm happy to Y." — express what you won't do through what you will do.
- Say "I can't, but X might be interested."
- Use awkward pauses to your advantage; don't be controlled by the threat of silence.

## Additional Principles

- Stop making casual commitments.
- Play is essential; it stimulates exploration.
- One way to deal with sunk costs is to pretend you don't already have it.
- Their problems are not your problems.
- Always leave buffer.
- Remove obstacles: Clarify essential intent → Identify the biggest obstacle → Remove it.
- Do small but meaningful things that make real progress.
- Do the hardest thing first each day.

## Output

1. Assessment: Is this a clear yes or should it be a no?
2. Reasoning: Why?
3. If declining: Suggested response using the graceful refusal techniques above.
