# Prioritize

Triage and prioritize a list of tasks using the **Eisenhower Matrix**. Focus on maximizing time in Quadrant 2 to prevent future crises.

## Priority Framework (The 4 Quadrants)

| Priority | Category | Description | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1** | **Urgent & Important** | Crises, pressing problems, deadlined projects. | **Do First** |
| **P2** | **Not Urgent & Important** | Prevention, productivity, planning, relationships. | **Schedule** |
| **P3** | **Urgent & Not Important** | Interruptions, some meetings/calls, minor issues. | **Delegate** |
| **P4** | **Not Urgent & Not Important** | Busy work, time wasters, trivial emails. | **Eliminate** |

## Detailed Definitions

### Q1: The Quadrant of Necessity

* **Focus:** Immediate action required.
* **Examples:** Severe server outages, imminent product launches, medical emergencies.

### Q2: The Quadrant of Strategic Growth

* **Focus:** Long-term value and sustainability.
* **Examples:** Writing documentation, system refactoring, skill training, deep work.
* **Goal:** Invest more time here to reduce Q1 tasks.

### Q3: The Quadrant of Deception

* **Focus:** High activity, low impact. Often driven by others' agendas.
* **Examples:** Most notifications, unproductive weekly syncs, "quick" favor requests.

### Q4: The Quadrant of Waste

* **Focus:** Distraction and avoidance.
* **Examples:** Infinite scrolling, organizing files that don't need organizing.

## Operational Strategy

> **"The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities."**

* **Protect Q2:** Say "no" or "not now" to Q3/Q4 tasks to safeguard P2 commitments.
* **Root Cause:** If Q1 is overwhelming, look for P2 planning tasks you've been skipping.

## Output Format

1. **Matrix View:** List tasks grouped by their respective Quadrants.
2. **Execution Order:** Provide a linear 1-N list based on priority.
3. **Strategic Advice:** A brief suggestion on how to move from Q1/Q3 toward Q2.
